/// ccTalk Coin Acceptor Error Codes
///
/// Represents the standardized error codes for ccTalk coin acceptors as defined in the
/// ccTalk Generic Specification (Part 3 v4.7) by Crane Payment Solutions.
///
/// These error codes are specific to coin acceptors and can be reported at any time in a
/// reply to a host credit poll. Not all coin acceptor manufacturers implement every error
/// code - the subset depends on the technology used and the device's self-diagnostic
/// capabilities.
///
/// # Error Categories
///
/// - **Coin Rejection**: Errors that definitely result in coin rejection
/// - **Possible Rejection**: Errors that may result in coin rejection
/// - **Hardware Issues**: Sensor blockages, timeouts, and mechanical failures
/// - **Fraud Detection**: Security-related errors indicating potential fraud attempts
/// - **Configuration**: Product configuration errors
/// - **Special Codes**: Data requests and unspecified alarms
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::convert::TryFrom;
/// use cc_talk_core::cc_talk::CoinAcceptorError;
///
/// // Convert from raw error code
/// let error = CoinAcceptorError::try_from(1).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(error, CoinAcceptorError::RejectCoin);
/// assert!(error.is_coin_rejected());
///
/// // Convert to raw error code
/// let code: u8 = CoinAcceptorError::ValidationTimeout.into();
